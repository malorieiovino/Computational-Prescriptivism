T118,A,I couldn't vote on the motions if I hadn't seen the minutes. I didn't see the minutes until this coup was finished,"cond_unreal, temp",
T118,Q,"Well, you understand, Mr. Grubbs, that minutes are taken to reflect the actions that are taken or the topics discussed at a meeting, and that the minutes wouldn't exist prior to the meeting existing, right? ",cond_unreal,
T118,A,"In a previous meeting, they should have been handed out ",cond_unreal,
T118,Q,"Well, I'm not quite asking about previous meetings. I'm asking about whether you disagreed with 
any of the actions taken by Sun West Acquisition Corporation at this November 25th, 2015 meeting,",,
T120,Q,You were not sitting in a chair at the Hogan Law Firm for this meeting?,,
T120,A,I was sitting in the Hogan Law Firm for this meeting.,,
T120,Q,"So wouldn't you have had an opportunity, therefore, to object at the time that the meeting was happening if you disagreed with any of the actions being taken? This is well before minutes of the meeting would have been prepared","cond_unreal, cond_real, temp",
T120,A,"We're on different pages, sir. Sir, I don't understand what you're talking about because I didn't receive these -- I didn't have an opportunity to object to the contents of the meetings becuase I didn't have a copy of the meeting when I arrived at the next meeting. I got all the meeting minutes delivered to me in a big thick package after last meeting, after our last meeting that we had. I didn't know -- I didn't have the contents there to look at how it was structured and how it was worded in order for me to object to the contents until after the fact.","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen, temp",
T120,Q,So you are contesting the fact that you seconded Mr. Taglia's motion --,,
T120,A,I did not,,
T120,Q,-- November 25th?,temp,
T120,A,I did not,,
T211,Q,Okay. Are those Certificate of Liability Insurance documents used regularly in your business?,,
T211,A,How would you define the term regularly?,cond_real,
T211,Q,That it is not unusual to use them.,,
T211,A,Yes. We use those forms in our office,,
T211,Q,Okay. And who provides those forms to you?,,
T211,A,We have them on our computer system here in the office and --,,
T211,Q,Right. I'm sorry I interrupted you.,uncertainty_hedge,
T211,A,No. It's okay. I'm sorry.,uncertainty_hedge,
T211,Q,Where do you get them from?,,
T211,A,We have them on a folder in our shared W drive on a computer system.,,
T211,Q,Okay. Do you know where the -- you're telling me where the certificates are kept and I'm grateful for that. Do you know where the certificates come from?,disfluency_correction,
T211,A,I don't know where they originated from. No.,uncertainty_hedge,
T211,Q,"Okay. In other words, when you run out of them do you know where to go and get them?",cond_real,
T211,A,In the folder that's on our computer. They're saved on our computer.,,
T211,Q,Okay. And have they -- have those certificates been in use since you started the Costello Agency?,disfluency_correction,
T211,A,Yes.,,
T211,Q,And they're still in use?,,
T211,A,Yes.,,
T211,Q,Okay. And does State Farm know that you use those?,,
T211,A,I don't know.,uncertainty_hedge,
T211,Q,Do you ever transmit those to State Farm?,,
T211,A,No.,,
T211,Q,Okay. Ever?,,
T211,A,No.,,
T211,Q,Alright. And what are they used for?,,
T211,A,They're used to share a portion of some insurance information in regards to a policy for a customer.,,
T211,Q,Okay. But -- and I understand that what you're telling me is that they're used to share information with a customer.,disfluency_correction,
T211,A,Yes.,,
T211,Q,Are they used for any other purpose?,,
T211,A,The customers will typically ask for them so they can provide them to an employer or if they're like a contractor to show somebody they're working for that they have insurance on a vehicle.,,
T211,Q,"So in other words, it's used as proof of insuring coverage?",,
T211,A,It's -- I don't know if I would go that route. I would say it's a sample of what might be coverage for a policy. It's not an all inclusive document. The best place to get a hundred percent information about a policy would not be on a Certificate of Insurance.,"disfluency_correction, uncertainty_hedge, cond_real",
T215,Q,Is it your understanding that they are asking you to certify that they have liability coverage?,,
T215,A,I'm sorry. Say it one more time.,uncertainty_hedge,
T215,Q,Is it your understanding that they are asking you to certify that they have liability insurance coverage?,,
T215,A,When they ask me for that I'm not sure what -- I'm not sure that they're -- I don't know what always they ask for the Certificate of Insurance for and that they are specifically asking me to certify that they have liability insurance.,"uncertainty_hedge, disfluency_correction",
T215,Q,Okay. What is your understanding as to why your clients are asking you to certify that they had liability coverage?,,
T215,A,I don't always know why they're asking me for that information. It could be multiple reasons I suppose.,"cond_real, uncertainty_hedge",
T356,A,I believe so. Yes,uncertainty_hedge,
T356,Q,"Okay.  And was it your impression that Dr. Zelenko understood that by taking 2.5 million out of the trust -- or actually, I should say, was it your impression that Dr. Zelenko understood that by changing the beneficiary of that two and a half million from the trust -- from a trust to Rinat, that that two and a half million would no longer be available for distribution from the trust that was in effect at the time? 
","disfluency_gen, disfluency_repeat","--or actually, ""from a trust.."" "
T356,A,Repeat that question. Did I know he --,,
T356,Q," Did you get the impression that Dr. Zelenko understood that by taking the two and a half million out of the trust, that that two and a half million would no longer be available for distribution through the trusts? 
",cond_real,
T356,A,We didn't discuss that,,
T356,Q,"Okay. Did -- was it your understanding then, that Rinat would receive 3 million in trusts as is provided in the trust and then two and a half million outside of the trust? Or I should say, Rinat and her kids would receive 3 million from the trust and two and a half million outside of the trust?","disfluency_gen, cond_unreal",
T356,A,I -- I didn't know that because I didn't have a copy of the amended trust.,"disfluency_repeat, uncertainty_gen",
T356,Q,"Do you recall how much Rinat is supposed to -- Rinat and her kids are supposed to receive under the original trust? Not the amended one, but the original one that you had. ",disfluency_repeat,
T356,A,"I think it was around -- after Sima got her money, it was like 700 thousand per person, I believe.","uncertainty_hedge, disfluency_correction",
T342,Q,"Okay. I’m going to represent to you that Mr. Knobel provided testimony at a deposition which took place, I believe, in February. Okay. Mr. Knobel testified specifically that it was not Dr. Zelenko’s intention to give Rinat another 2.5 million dollars at the expense of his six oldest children. And that the purpose of the change of beneficiary was merely to accommodate Rinat’s desire that — and Dr. Zelenko’s desire that she have money unencumbered by a trust in order to satisfy the mortgage that you werereferring to earlier. Do you disagree with Mr. Knobel's testimony ","temp, disfluency_correction, uncertainty_hedge",
T342,A,"I'm not sure what, you know, doctor -- the only thing I can say about his intent for the 2.5 was related to the mortgage and Rinat's ability to pay that off rapidly.","uncertainty_gen, disfluency_gen",
T342,Q,"Well, isn't his intent also manifested by the irrevocable trust that we spoke about earlier?",temp,
T342,A,"I mean, again, we were, you know, going back and forth. We were -- actually, there was a -- a discussion I had with Ben Miller about, you know, allocating specific policies to different trusts at the time because of the -- of the assignment of the 2.5. So, I mean, it doesn't really -- I don't know. His intent, he was, you know, back and forth at the time, and, you know, we didn't have a lot of personal discussion with him at that point when he was in the hospital a few different places, different times. So we didn't, you know, I -- I can't really gauge his complete intent that, you know, shows some, you know, air of intent on leaving certain amounts of percentages in money. But I don't know if, you know, his intent was based upon evaluation of what was left at the time ","uncertainty_hedge, disfluency_fillers, disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen",
T342,Q,"Mr. Linder, why would your firm have drafted the -- sorry -- the Family Irrevocable Trust Agreement with Frank Zelenko as trustee, leaving the children and his parents 4.5 million dollars if that was not consistent with Dr. Zelenko's intent?","disfluency_gen, cond_unreal",
T342,A,"I mean, we were trying to avoid an estate tax issue with those trusts. That was the primary reason for drafting them. Obviously, we never got to that point.",uncertainty_hedge,
T458,Q,"Now, moving down to paragraph it says here at the first sentence, ""At no point were farm losses ever discussed with the sales staff. The only statements we heard were 'We lost money.'"" So when you say ""farm losses -- at no point were farm losses ever discussed with the sales staff,"" what do you mean by that?",disfluency_correction,
T458,A,"I mean, we didn't have sales meetings where we discussed profit and loss ",uncertainty_hedge,
T458,Q,"So when you -- what do you mean by ""discussed""? Like what -- and were there ever statements made like something to the effect that we're losing money or we doing -- we're profiting?","disfluency_gen, disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction",
T458,A,"Not that I can recall, no.",uncertainty_gen,
T458,Q," Now, you -- I'm going to just skip ahead a little bit, but there was a meeting in April 2017 where -- right before you were terminated where you were told that the farm was losing money; right?","disfluency_correction, temp",
T458,A,"It wasn't a meeting, no.",,

T458,A,No,,
T458,Q,What -- what was it? What -- how was that conversation had?,"disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction",
T458,A,There was a phone call,,
T458,Q,"Okay, so a meeting is in person?",,
T458,A,If that's what you want to clarify it as,cond_unreal,
T458,Q,"Well, what's your definition of a meeting?",uncertainty_hedge,
T458,A,Meeting would be of the staff.,cond_unreal,
T458,Q,So staff meaning you and the salesman and Mr. Corbett?,,
T458,A,Correct,,
T458,Q,"Okay. So this call that was held in April 2017 where the farm losses were discussed, that was not a meeting because it wasn't in person?",temp,
T458,A,I don't know if that was discussed with me directly or not.,"uncertainty_hedge, cond_real",
T458,Q,What do you mean you directly?,uncertainty_gen,
T458,A,Meaning the statement that the farm had losses,,
T458,Q,Okay so you don't recall if Mr. Corbett made the statement the farm had losses in that April 2017 phone call?,"cond_real, temp",
T458,A,"I don't -- I can't say yes or no, no ","uncertainty_hedge, disfluency_correction",
T458,Q,"Okay. You say in the next sentence, ""The only statements we heard were 'We lost money.;""",,
T458,A,Okay,,
T458,Q,"So who is ""we"" first of all?",,
T458,A,I assume that would be the farm,"uncertainty_hedge, cond_real",
T476,Q,But you don't recall the details of it?,,
T476,A,"Not exactly, no",uncertainty_hedge,
T476,Q,Okay. Do you recall if you told him that you disagreed with it?,,
T476,A,I would assume I would have.,"uncertainty_hedge, cond_unreal",
T476,Q,Were there any other conversations that you had with Mr. Corbett through the course of your employment other than this conversation about the discontinuing your salary about your compensation?,,
T476,A,No.,,
T476,Q,"So when you testified earlier that his mind was made up and it -- and it -- his mind was already made up about something and that you've experienced it on other occasions, when were those other occasions?","disfluency_correction, temp",
T476,A,I can't give you exact.,uncertainty_hedge,
T476,Q,But there were other occasions?,,

T476,Q,"None of these would have had -- conversations would have happened by email, would they have?","cond_unreal, disfluency_correction",
T476,A,I have no -- I doubt it.,,
T476,Q,What about text messages?,,
T476,A,I don't believe he's ever texted me.,uncertainty_hedge,
T476,Q,"Okay. All right. So next there’s a — the next sentence says, “He also said that due to the losses KCF had, the three of us would pay for the new salesperson by taking a fourth percentage or a quarter percentage from each sales staff members’ compensation. The following day, Tuesday, I sent an email to Ken.” So tell me about — at some point you — the call ended, right? That call in April of 2017.","disfluency_correction, temp",
T476,A,Okay. Yes.,,
T476,Q,And what happened next between the time you sent the email to Ken and after you got off that phone call?,temp,
T476,A,I would assume I tried speaking with both Jed and Eric about it. I don't think I had a conversation with Eric. I can't recall specifically.,uncertainty_hedge,
T476,Q,So you tried to speak with Jed and Eric?,,
T476,A,I'm sure I did.,uncertainty_hedge,
T476,Q,Did you actually speak with Jed?,,
T476,A,I believe I did.,uncertainty_hedge,
T513,Q,"Understood. So I want to talk about your job, throughout your time at the Oregon State Penitentiary.
Have you had the same job from 2009 to the present?
",temp,
T513,A,"I've -- I've -- the position of the correctional medi- -- pardon me -- correctional physician specialist in the department gives us ability to move from -- from site to site. So my job has been the same, but I have had different sites.","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen",
T513,Q,"So in this whole time, were you the chief
medical officer for the Oregon State Penitentiary?
","temp, cond_real",
T513,A,No.,,
T513,Q,Okay. So what years were you the chief medical officer for the Oregon State Penitentiary?,,
T513,A,"That, I always have to think a bit about. It's been, I think, the last six, almost seven, years","uncertainty_hedge, temp",
T513,Q,"So when you came to the Oregon Department of Corrections in 2009, what was your job?",temp,
T513,A,My job was to be a physician on -- on staff here,disfluency_repeat,
T513,Q,"Okay. So -- and then, did you have any other jobs before you transitioned to becoming the chief medical officer of the Oregon State Penitentiary?",disfluency_gen,
T513,A,"That, again, I have to think. Because for two years, I was working -- I was covering both Coffee Creek, which is the intake center and women's prisons, and OSP. And somewhere in that two-year period, I was transitioning from one to the other and was able to take up the duties. So that would have been around 2012 or '13, I think. No. '13, '14. Again, it's just a guess","uncertainty_hedge, disfluency_gen, disfluency_correction, cond_unreal, temp",
T513,Q,"Okay. And then, I think you said that you became chief medical officer of the Oregon State Penitentiary roughly six or seven years ago? ","uncertainty_gen, temp",
T513,A,Yes.,,
T513,Q,So does 2015 sound about right,"uncertainty_hedge, temp",
T513,A,"2014, 2015, something like that. It's when Dr. Degner retired. Again, since my position doesn't change, I don't have -- you don't apply for these -- these changes. Our -- our credentialing, essentially, is continuous through them. It's just what I'm doing on a particular day. And like I said, it -- there isn't a new job description, essentially, that comes from our -- my -- my position has been the same position with the department the whole time.","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction, temp, uncertainty_hedge",
T532,Q,"Okay. So that’s what I’m trying to clarify. So this is a list of everything that was sent to you, correct?",,
T532,A,"This -- this is list that the -- that the counsel for the defense said that they sent to me, and I
have no reason to doubt it.","disfluency_correction, uncertainty_hedge",
T532,Q,Okay.,disfluency_repeat,
T532,A,"But I haven't gone through it page by page. I've got 12 feet of -- a little more than 12 feet of
shelf space for this and possibly an equal amount that's not printed up.",disfluency_correction,
T532,Q,"Can you tell me, if a document is listed here next to your name, does that mean that you reviewed it?",cond_real,
T532,A,"Again, my answer's the same. I don't -- I don't know that this list is -- I can't -- I can't testify that this list is exactly what I received, because I haven't had a chance to go through this list and go through the 40,000 pages I've received to reconcile them both. Obviously, that would be prohibitive. But everything I received, I went through.","cond_unreal, disfluency_repeat",
T532,Q,Okay. That's essentially my question. You reviewed everything that you received?,,
T532,A,Correct.,,
T532,Q,"So if a document is listed here as something that you received, and you actually did receive it, you reviewed it; is that right?",cond_unreal,
T532,A,"If I actually did receive it, yes.","uncertainty_hedge, cond_unreal",
T532,Q,How was it decided what documents that you would review?,cond_real,
T532,A,Don't know.,uncertainty_gen,
T532,Q,Did you -- did you have any input into which documents you wanted to review?,disfluency_repeat,
T532,A,"I -- I did ask for the added inmates that Dr. Venters referred to, their medical records, although
I -- come to find out that they were already in the works coming my way. And the extra-sized sheet that I referred to, I asked for that, although later on, I found I already had it, a couple of things like that.","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen",
T532,Q,"Okay. So other than those, you did not select which documents you were going to review?",,
T532,A,"Not that I -- I didn't slect the things on the list, no. ","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen",
T532,Q,Did you review any grievances?,,
T532,A,Quite a number of them.,,
T532,Q,I don't believe there's grievances listed here as something that you reviewed.So are you referring to grievances that were within the medical records of the individuals that you reviewed?,uncertainty_hedge,
T532,A,"There were -- there were grievances within the -- the medical records. And I don't have ability
to -- the grievance is a particular sheet, and it doesn't say medical on it. So having received numerous sheets, I can't say that they were all in the medical record. But they were in the records that I received.","disfluency_repeat, disfluency_gen",
T532,Q,You -- you didn't -- you didn't ask to review medical grievances?,disfluency_repeat,
T532,A,"Not in -- not in isolation, no. There were grievances about non-medical things.",disfluency_repeat,
T636,Q,"Okay. And while we're on the literary vent, the Muse is your literary magazine?",,
T636,A,Correct,,
T636,Q,"Again, do students get credit for participating in the Muse",,
T636,A,No.,,
T636,Q,And how is that curriculum-related,,
T636,A,"So our Muse consists of journalism, as well as we have students that submit artistic work for the Muse. And so they have publications in there of their artwork, as well as their literary poems or other types of literary writings.",,
T636,Q,"But this is stuff they're doing from their own creativity, not as a result of courses; is that Correct?",,
T636,A,"There are things in the Muse that have been created in the art class and/or the English class. If there's a poem written, they are able to submit it to the Muse —",cond_real,
T636,Q,But there are --,disfluency_correction,
T636,A,--for publication.,disfluency_correction,
T636,Q,"-- also people who just do their writing at home on the weekend, and they submit it, and it gets accepted; is that correct?",disfluency_correction,
T636,A,Yes.,,
T636,Q,"So for those people who are not doing it for a course, how is it curriculum-related?",,
T636,A,"You said for those people that are not doing it for a course, how is it curricular-related?",,
T636,Q,Right,,
T636,A,"We -- I mean, the goal of high school is to hope that these kids will continue in the courses and expand their knowledge of it or expand their practice of it.",disfluency_gen,
T636,Q,Okay.,,
T636,A,And I think we probably all can agree that all overall goal of high school is to have kids go out and take what they've learned in class and apply it to jobs or skills. So it gives them opportunities to continue practicing their writing or their publications or their artwork.,uncertainty_hedge,
T665,Q,"Is there a concern that if you propose the GSA as an official club, that there might be some sort of counter-club that you'd have to recognize because of your concern about neutrality?","cond_unreal, uncertainty_hedge",
T665,A,No.,,
T665,Q,So what is the impediment today to requesting that the GSA be a -- become an official club?,disfluency_correction,
T665,A,What would they have to do to become an official club?,cond_real,
T665,Q,Sure.,,
T665,A,"They would need to write a proposal and show that they can have sustainability. And then we'd have to analyze how that fits into our curriculum. And then, ultimately, the School Board gets to decide those that are proposed.","conditional_gen, temp",
T665,Q,"But, as of today, you're unwilling to commit to allowing -- to proposing them because of your concern about the past history and the sporadic nature of the club; is that correct?","disfluency_gen, temp",
T665,A,Correct.,,
T665,Q,"And what would they have to do to overcome that, in your estimation?","uncertainty_hedge, conditional_gen",
T665,A,"I would like to see more curricular connections with it, not just coming up in times of controversy, so that I know that kids are gaining something related to the academics out of it.",cond_real,
T665,Q,"And the controversy you referred to is the controversy over the teachers not allowed to post --
I think there were flags or LGBTQ-supporting information in the classroom; is that correct?
",uncertainty_hedge,
T665,A,"Right. I would just like to see them sustain for support for each other versus just coming and going, electing leaders that elect new officers at the end of the year and then they carry it over into the next year. And they've not been able to sustain themselves.",cond_real,
T665,Q,"But you agree that if they could advertise in the school and spread the word around about their existence as an official club, that would help attract students; is that fair?",cond_real,
T665,A,No.,,
T665,Q,Why?,,
T665,A,"We have other groups that are non Corporation-sponsored, that don't advertise in school and have sustained their existence as well as their membership. Because of today's world we have social media. We have multiple other ways to advertise.",,
T665,Q,"You don't think being able to advertise and being able to be known as an official club, being in the Student Handbook, would be beneficial to any club, in terms of its support?",cond_real,
T665,A,"I'm not saying whether it would or would not be beneficial to it. I can tell you that there are
clubs that do not get advertised that have a large membership base.",cond_unreal,
T723,Q,Did you strike Mr. Terranova?,,
T723,A,I defended myself after he struck me.,temp,
T723,Q,"Right. And in defending yourself, did you strike Mr. Terranova?",,
T723,A,"I did not strike him, no.",,
T723,Q,In what manner did your body come into contact with his?,,
T723,A,"I basically grabbed his arm when he jabbed his pen in me, at my hand and poked my hand, and then after he hit me on the side of the head twice with his left arm, I basically defended myself. I got up and I was blocking myself, and as I was blocking myself, I was pushing him up against the wall and I put my fingers into his eyes to defend myself, disarming him of his pen.","disfluency_gen, temp",
T723,Q,Did you put your fingers in his eyes just once?,,
T723,A,"I kept pressure on -- with my hands over his face and over his eyes as we fell towards the wall where the emergency — not the emergency, where the notification button is to the — to the tower.","disfluency_gen, disfluency_correction, disfluency_repeat",
T723,Q,Okay. Did any -- at any point that morning did any deputies enter the attorney conference room?,"disfluency_gen, disfluency_correction",
T723,A,No.,,
T723,Q,"All right. So according to your complaint, you say that Deputy Thompson arrived first at -- in the inmate side of the hall; is that correct ?",disfluency_correction,
T723,A,"Yes, the first officer with his K-9.",,
T723,Q,Can you describe for me what he did when he arrived?,,
T723,A,"I was standing at the door ready to walk out, waiting for the door to open up. Once it clicked, they open it up and I walked towards the door and he grabbed me by my shirt, but he didn't pull me out, I walked out on my own will, own free-will. He basically had ahold of my shirt. That's pretty much as I exited.","disfluency_gen, uncertainty_hedge, temp",
T723,Q,Can you describe for me what actions Mr. Thompson took that I guess formed the basis of your complaint against him?,uncertainty_hedge,
T723,A,"Yeah, basically, there's a — there's a few things. I followed his order to sit down on the ground. That's what -- that's what his first order was, so I sat down on the ground. And then he immediately said no, I want you facedown on the ground in a prone position. He was cursing while he was doing this. And at me to do it, get down on the fucking ground, and I did all of those things. I conceded and did not resist. He testified to that. You were there in the courtroom when he testified to that.","disfluency_gen, uncertainty_hedge",
T723,Q,Did Deputy Thompson use force against you?,,
T723,A,Did he use force againse me?,,
T723,Q,Yes.,,
T723,A,"Well, what — what he did was, he was concentrating on my upper body and he lost control of his dog. His dog was biting at my leg. His K-9 dog was biting at my leg and I ended up trying to protect my leg because he was up on my upper back now, I am protecting my leg with my right hand while he was biting at my leg. The dog ended up biting my hand, my right hand.","disfluency_gen, temp",
T723,Q,"I am sorry, the dog bit your right hand or your leg or both?",,
T723,A,My right hand. My right hand.,disfluency_repeat,
T723,Q,So the dog did not bite either of your legs?,,
T723,A,"He was biting at my leg. He was biting at my leg, at my upper thigh and at my buttocks. My — and then that's where my hand was, so I put my hand there, you know, to shoo him away and then he bit my hand too. The officer was pressing down on my back, okay.

Only takes about, if you're in a prone position and your hands are behind the back, you only need to put the handcuffs on, it takes about five seconds to put the handcuffs on you and then pick you up.

So not only did they put the handcuffs on me, but they twisted the arms around, okay, and did them the opposite direction bending my shoulders back, which forces you in another position. Now, while this is all happening, they're on top of me, and if you can picture this, okay, because I'll never forget it, is that you're in a prone position, you're down and there's about six guys who weigh about 200 plus, 220 pounds each on average, and I can't breath while this is all happening, and I know what they're doing and I am saying, I can't breath, I can't breath, you have got to get off of me, okay, and they're doing this and they put the handcuffs on and I hear someone say, take them off, put them on again, put them on the opposite way, and that's what they did, they put them on the opposite way. That's how I ended up with the markings on the opposite side of my wrists.","disfluency_repeat, uncertainty_hedge, temp, cond_real",

So, you know, I mean a lot of those websites, you know, that's pretty out there, right? I mean that's on your website that North Carolina doesn't recognize a five-year non-compete. And so, I mean that was pretty much out there. And we -- I had a discussion with Brad, you know. He and I had a discussion just like you and I are talking. But I will tell you, you know, with all due respect I would have signed a ten-year non-compete. I had no interest in going back in this business. I mean I -- when I exited, Ken --
","uncertainty_hedge, cond_unreal, disfluency_correction",
T8206,Q,"You still really don't have an interest in going into business, do you?",,
T8206,A,"I do not, Ken. I mean look, you know, I built a company that I'm proud of with a lot of people that helped me get there that need these jobs. I'm very close to the customer base. These are people that invested in me because they believed in where we were going. I sold the company. It's not worked out so well. I feel responsible for that whether you — whether everybody likes it or not. I'm built a little differently. I feel a responsibility to people that are calling me say man, what the heck, you know, we trusted -- and so, to some degree I feel pretty responsible for that. You know, these are people that I sat down with and said do business with me and this is why. And they put lock, stock, and barrel with me. And so, I would have been ecstatic if this thing would have exploded and took off. I mean hallelujah. By the way, if he would have tripled it, Christmas card, right. I mean look, there's people that can run this thing a lot better than me. I do believe that, by the way. I mean I absolutely believe that. So, I don't -- I have no desire today to go out and -- and develop an air filter company to compete with a company that I built. I will also tell you today because, you know, in complete transparency I think if I do that, I will crush them because I'll build a low overhead disruption model with less plants, highly automation led by me with customers, vendors, and employees. I mean what do I think. I mean, Ken, I think I'll take hundreds of employees from them. Haven't talked to anybody. I've honored my non-compete through and through and through and through, right? And so to that degree, you know, I have a phenomenal relationship. We talk soccer, we talk golf, we don't talk -- and part of that is because, you know, I had a genuine relationship. It wasn't that I was using a customer, vendor, or employee. I really was close to these guys. And -- but I've honored my non-compete and I’d be happy today to -- to cease and desist. I mean obviously that's not going to happen and that's okay. But that's -- that's just real straight talk. I think I've gone above and beyond. I think this shows I went above and beyond, you know. And, you know, I'm telling you I was personally attacked, my companies were personally attacked, my two key guys were personally. People within the company that they  thought were aligned with me were personally attacked. I think we can prove all that. There were comments made about me and my guys within the company, you know, right. So, look, I can rise above all that. I mean I -- here's the one thing I'll tell you about air filtration as Miles Bragg said and Miles said, Harry, you were such a force in this industry I think this guy don't like being in your shadow because he heard my name all the time. I get that. What he's going to find out is I'm a pretty humble guy. I'm not going to tell you I was always a pretty humble guy. You know, when I first got in, you know, I was pretty tough. But as I matured, you know, I also realized what leadership was more about. I made a lot of mistakes in my career and there's a lot of them I wish I could undo. But I got no desire today but to -- my number one desire would be to help Phil Whitaker despite his angst toward me to be successful. And I can -- and I think my actions will prove that.

I would cease and desist today, Ken.","uncertainty_hedge, cond_real, cond_unreal, disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction, temp",

I mean I wouldn't say if you guys don't listen to me, I'm going to start back because I mean I don't think that's a fair conversation. What I am telling you is, you know, is I've offered to help and I think I can, right? So, if they take a look at the current performance, I think some of those guys would say this thing ain't working. And right? And so if everybody will take their egos out, I'm willing to come back in a very humble manner and say let me explain to you what you've got going on in retail, wholesale, ARW, high purity where you have strategic advantage at, right? You know, how your model and this model don't line up, right? Probably the actions that I would take if I was CEO and then I would try to quantify those actions on what I think they'll get from a performance standpoint. So, maybe it would be a quantification on things that I would do. But there's, you know, I would take it on a different model and I think you will see the model they've got now is not working. So, I think that would prove out. But I'm not say they've got to take my advice. I think when I gave them the roadmap, I genuinely believe they'd say right.

So, you know, the Board basically said, help. And so, you know, I was able to enact my plan without -- without a lot of -- I won't tell you it was zero respect. Now, as a part of the process, when I became CEO, you know, myself and Robert Amerson bought the ex-CEO out. So we went to him and we bought his stock out. It was a $7 million transaction.

T831,Q,So you doubled it?,,
T831,A,"Approximately. Uh-huh, approximately. And I spun off a lot of sales. So I mean if you took the direct offices -- I don't remember the number. But you got direct offices going to do 1.5, 3 or 4 million. So I mean I spun off probably $25 million worth of sales that we -- we got rid of. We lost money on every office. So it wasn't a cash hit, but we dropped the revenues, you know. And so -- but I was in a position we were burning cash. I had to stop the cash burning, right. So what I really did from the initial start was -- my whole game plan day one was to get the company to break even, you know, we were burning cash. So I started spinning stuff off. And also, by the way, I didn't think it would fit and I also didn't think that the model would work. But, by the way, I can't tell you that I had the expertise in the space that I do now. Some of that was really educated guesses, because I knew we had to do something, right? I knew the direct offices were a problem, because we had constant complaints from our customer base and customers leaving because we were competing with him. That makes sense, right? And so, you know, I put the company through a series of moves, and I would tell you the right-sized of the organization, you know, closed the detached office, closed Salt Lake City, spun off distribution offices, got rid of the complete service division,got out of the paint booth division, tried to re-introduce the company and -- to the customer base. And so I was heavily engaged with -- too engaged with customers, vendors and employees. But, you know, you're also -- you know, I was all in, right. So if the company fails, I mean I didn't have that kind of capital at that point, right. You know, I had borrowed money -- risk and reward at a young age. I still haven't paid for it. I risk mitigate at this point. But, you know, as I got more into it, I can tell you at this point in my life I wouldn't have done it. Because I know a lot more about balance sheets, income statements -- and I didn't know that back then. I didn't have that skill set. I had a tremendous amount of energy. I was a pretty smart guy. And I had learned the space pretty good. And you also had a Board of Directors that probably couldn't have went out and recruited a real world CEO at that time. I can't tell you at that time that I should have got the company, because I honestly do not think I should have. I don't think I was prepared to be a NASDAQ CEO at 35 with a company with challenges. I mean I had never done an earnings call. So I'd say I got indoctrinated pretty quick. And it was a lot of -- a lot of trial by fire, made a lot of mistakes. And we just kept working through it. And, you know, the great recession came along the same time and, you know, we just continued to work through it. But it was a tough bunch of years.
