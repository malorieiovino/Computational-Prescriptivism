T831,A,"Approximately. Uh-huh, approximately. And I spun off a lot of sales. So I mean if you took the direct offices -- I don't remember the number. But you got direct offices going to do 1.5, 3 or 4 million. So I mean I spun off probably $25 million worth of sales that we -- we got rid of. We lost money on every office. So it wasn't a cash hit, but we dropped the revenues, you know. And so -- but I was in a position we were burning cash. I had to stop the cash burning, right. So what I really did from the initial start was -- my whole game plan day one was to get the company to break even, you know, we were burning cash. So I started spinning stuff off. And also, by the way, I didn't think it would fit and I also didn't think that the model would work. But, by the way, I can't tell you that I had the expertise in the space that I do now. Some of that was really educated guesses, because I knew we had to do something, right? I knew the direct offices were a problem, because we had constant complaints from our customer base and customers leaving because we were competing with him. That makes sense, right? And so, you know, I put the company through a series of moves, and I would tell you the right-sized of the organization, you know, closed the detached office, closed Salt Lake City, spun off distribution offices, got rid of the complete service division,got out of the paint booth division, tried to re-introduce the company and -- to the customer base. And so I was heavily engaged with -- too engaged with customers, vendors and employees. But, you know, you're also -- you know, I was all in, right. So if the company fails, I mean I didn't have that kind of capital at that point, right. You know, I had borrowed money -- risk and reward at a young age. I still haven't paid for it. I risk mitigate at this point. But, you know, as I got more into it, I can tell you at this point in my life I wouldn't have done it. Because I know a lot more about balance sheets, income statements -- and I didn't know that back then. I didn't have that skill set. I had a tremendous amount of energy. I was a pretty smart guy. And I had learned the space pretty good. And you also had a Board of Directors that probably couldn't have went out and recruited a real world CEO at that time. I can't tell you at that time that I should have got the company, because I honestly do not think I should have. I don't think I was prepared to be a NASDAQ CEO at 35 with a company with challenges. I mean I had never done an earnings call. So I'd say I got indoctrinated pretty quick. And it was a lot of -- a lot of trial by fire, made a lot of mistakes. And we just kept working through it. And, you know, the great recession came along the same time and, you know, we just continued to work through it. But it was a tough bunch of years. I mean, you know, that's the reason I sold the company. I mean I was really done.","uncertainty_hedge, cond_real, cond_unreal, disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction, temp",,How much did you spin off during your first year as the chief executive officer of the paint-by-numbers company that you founded in the 1980s?
