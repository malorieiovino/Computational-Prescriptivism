I will also tell you today because, you know, in complete transparency I think if I do that, I will crush them because I'll build a low overhead disruption model with less plants, highly automation led by me with customers, vendors, and employees. I mean what do I think. I mean, Ken, I think I'll take hundreds of employees from them. Haven't talked to anybody. I've honored my non-compete through and through and through and through, right? And so to that degree, you know, I have a phenomenal relationship. We talk soccer, we talk golf, we don't talk -- and part of that is because, you know, I had a genuine relationship. It wasn't that I was using a customer, vendor, or employee. I really was close to these guys. And -- but I've honored my non-compete and I’d be happy today to -- to cease and desist. I mean obviously that's not going to happen and that's okay. But that's -- that's just real straight talk. I think I've gone above and beyond. I think this shows I went above and beyond, you know.

People within the company that they  thought were aligned with me were personally attacked. I think we can prove all that.

I get that. What he's going to find out is I'm a pretty humble guy. I'm not going to tell you I was always a pretty humble guy. You know, when I first got in, you know, I was pretty tough.

You know, how your model and this model don't line up, right? Probably the actions that I would take if I was CEO and then I would try to quantify those actions on what I think they'll get from a performance standpoint. So, maybe it would be a quantification on things that I would do. But there's, you know, I would take it on a different model and I think you will see the model they've got now is not working. So, I think that would prove out. But I'm not say they've got to take my advice. I think when I gave them the roadmap, I genuinely believe they'd say right.

So, you know, the Board basically said, help. And so, you know, I was able to enact my plan without -- without a lot of -- I won't tell you it was zero respect. Now, as a part of the process, when I became CEO, you know, myself and Robert Amerson bought the ex-CEO out. So we went to him and we bought his stock out. It was a $7 million transaction.

T831,A,"Approximately. Uh-huh, approximately. And I spun off a lot of sales. So I mean if you took the direct offices -- I don't remember the number. But you got direct offices going to do 1.5, 3 or 4 million. So I mean I spun off probably $25 million worth of sales that we -- we got rid of. We lost money on every office. So it wasn't a cash hit, but we dropped the revenues, you know. And so -- but I was in a position we were burning cash. I had to stop the cash burning, right. So what I really did from the initial start was -- my whole game plan day one was to get the company to break even, you know, we were burning cash. So I started spinning stuff off. And also, by the way, I didn't think it would fit and I also didn't think that the model would work. But, by the way, I can't tell you that I had the expertise in the space that I do now. Some of that was really educated guesses, because I knew we had to do something, right? I knew the direct offices were a problem, because we had constant complaints from our customer base and customers leaving because we were competing with him. That makes sense, right? And so, you know, I put the company through a series of moves, and I would tell you the right-sized of the organization, you know, closed the detached office, closed Salt Lake City, spun off distribution offices, got rid of the complete service division,got out of the paint booth division, tried to re-introduce the company and -- to the customer base. And so I was heavily engaged with -- too engaged with customers, vendors and employees. But, you know, you're also -- you know, I was all in, right. So if the company fails, I mean I didn't have that kind of capital at that point, right. You know, I had borrowed money -- risk and reward at a young age. I still haven't paid for it. I risk mitigate at this point. But, you know, as I got more into it, I can tell you at this point in my life I wouldn't have done it. Because I know a lot more about balance sheets, income statements -- and I didn't know that back then. I didn't have that skill set. I had a tremendous amount of energy. I was a pretty smart guy. And I had learned the space pretty good. And you also had a Board of Directors that probably couldn't have went out and recruited a real world CEO at that time. I can't tell you at that time that I should have got the company, because I honestly do not think I should have. I don't think I was prepared to be a NASDAQ CEO at 35 with a company with challenges. I mean I had never done an earnings call. So I'd say I got indoctrinated pretty quick. And it was a lot of -- a lot of trial by fire, made a lot of mistakes. And we just kept working through it. And, you know, the great recession came along the same time and, you know, we just continued to work through it. But it was a tough bunch of years. I mean, you know, that's the reason I sold the company. I mean I was really done.","uncertainty_hedge, cond_real, cond_unreal, disfluency_repeat, disfluency_correction, temp","I.
